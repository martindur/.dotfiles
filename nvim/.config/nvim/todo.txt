1. easy to use "replace all"
2. font ligatuuuures! 
3. Good key binding for brackets? This key: ½ (next to 1), and maybe <leader>½ for closing, or other brackets?
4. Multi-line indent (There might be a plugin that handles this)
5. Run tests in current file (Maybe even current test case (class/function)?)
6. Get Oh-My-Fish! for fish shell - DONE!
7. Install FiraCode Nerd Font
8. Try out VimWiki, for personal notes, and todo lists! Maybe better than "this"?
